# Bouncing.io

- In my final version I made multiple shapes which interact with one another using an arrayList function which I learned can keep any amount of a certain class inside depending on how much is called. I found making the functions in processing that make the balls bounce off on another pretty challenging. I addionally learned about for() {} lists which make it so that something happens to an object that is a certain class and the same thing happens every time.
